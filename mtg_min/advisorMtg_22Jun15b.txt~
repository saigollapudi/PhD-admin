WHAT: PhD advisory mtg with Prof. Choppella
WHEN: June 22, 2015 - 4:30pm
WHO: Sai Gollapudi (myself, SG), Prof. Choppella (VC), Annon (An)

    VC discussed his demo tool proposal with An.
    An was suggesting that existing Sweet Apps like Alipi and Img Annotation (now Restory) would work
    SG pointed out that Alipi does not quite work for dynamic page. There was some discussion on this.  VC dismissed this as details.
    SG pointed out to An that, in the past, Virtual Lab pages were not editable on Alipi and that there were some practical issues.
    An looked confident that with minor modifications we could offer existing Sweet Apps as a solution
    An mentioned that he would be unavailable in early July (due to a Paris conference)
