* Work accomplished
** Work accomplished by Summer end
+ All three published paper presentated.
+ Study of related work for developing renarration service to Alipi,
  which includes: study of existing user profiles, user profile
  creation and their matching, rules to match the profile and
  renarration, algorithm to select the best renarration for a reader.
  1) Looked at the implementation design and other related issues.
     Finalized the design and the work required to be done. 
  2) Completed the literature survey of user profiles.
+ TAC work
  1) Slot Filling task coding and documentation.
  2) Entity Linking task coding and documentation.
+ Power of Friends study and paper draft.


* Current semester plan (Monsoon sem. 2012)
** Work on renarration service for Alipi framework
+ Chrome extension to provide ontology based user profile. 
+ Define user study for the the ontological service.  
  - Domain to be tested: one of the Vlabs lab, may be PoPL.
  - Define the population sample who will consume the re-narrated
    pages  (consumers).  This can be defined in two dimensions:
    - Number of users using the developed user profile for
      browsing. Here, the emphasis is on the larger population sample
      of users.
    - Number of re-narrated pages each user has browsed.  Here, the
      emphasis is on the number of re-narrated pages available as
      options for the users.
    - Define the re-narrators to re-narrate webpages using the
      developed profile.
 + Working on the paper draft. 

** TAC work completion
- coding left for Entity Linking
- documentation of Slot Filling and Entity Linking
  
** Power of Friends submission
- Finishing the draft of the paper followed by submission in
  OzCHI 2012.

** Thesis completion
- Define thesis structure, flow of how to connect all the explored
  research areas with each other.
- Writing.


* Work accomplished in August:
** Renarration service for Alipi framework:
1. Plugin development: requires little work on user authentication
   from Alipi server. 
2. Re-narration algorithm is implemented.
3. User study formulated.
4. Rough draft is ready.

** TAC work:
Coding finished for Slot Filling and Entity Linking.

** Power of Friends:
Paper submitted

** Thesis writing:
- Flow finalised.  
- Rough draft on objectives
- Introduction chapter started.
- One chapter draft on Knowledge extraction and validation is almost
  ready.

* September plan:
** Paper on renarration service for Alipi framework
- conduct user study
- improvising the paper draft

** TAC work documentation
- documentation of both Slot Filling and Entity-Linking task.

** Thesis completion
- a rough draft of whole thesis

* Deadlines
** Deadlines to follow:
W4A 2013 (not announced yet)
