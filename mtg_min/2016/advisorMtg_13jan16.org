WHAT: nptel demo disccussion mtg
WHO: Venkatesh Choppella (VC), Sai Gollapudi (SG)
WHEN: Jan 13, 2016
WHERE: VC sir's office at 2pm


Key points discussed:

+ SG talked about the concept of Topic Maps, ontologies and linking it
  with Educational Technology. VC found the concept interesting 
+ SG tried to show the PhD narrative overview ... it was on GitHub
+ VC wants the PhD work protected. He advised the PhD docs to be moved
  from GitHub to a private repository in Bitbucket.
+ VC wants a more tactical roadmap of which conferences, which
  journals?
+ 6 papers have aready been published (good). 2-3 more
  papers would help. But, more relavent would be some journal papers
+ 1 domain journal (Educational Techn?) and one CSE Journal on
  Architecture (technical) would be ideal. Journals take time to write
  and access... so, we need to prepare and plan
+ VC's advice is to first fix the Journals and work backwards identify
  current tasks, activities, timelines
+ VC wanted a roadmap charted in the next few days
