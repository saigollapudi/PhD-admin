**Worksheet Daily Log**

* 31st May: 
- Updated [[file:../thesis.org][thesis]] with the summaries of papers on ontology
matching.  
- Browsed for the turotials and use of different APIs, such as, Jena
API, SIOC, Protege.
- A rough draft on ontology service.

** Doubts regarding implementation of ontology: 
- How to make user profile that is easily portable to browser plugin?
- How to use the profile created by using an available above mentioned
  APIs for ontology creation?
- Do we really need such APIs or can we use a basic approach to
  develop user profile?  
- Cold start problem to create user profile:
   + Does importing user profile data from Facebook come under
     security bleach?  How many people will allow such an import?
   + Asking users to fill the proile information can not be expected,
     because the related papers conclude very least interest of users
     in such tasks.  


* 1st June:
- Prepared a [[file:../projects/alipi/docs/onto-services/ontology-service-for-alipi.org][draft]] on how the Alipi archtecture works with profiles of
  reader, re-narrator and web-page; possible attributes for each of
  the three profiles; write an example to formalize how matching could
  be done.

- Came across a new ontology way of creating user profile,i.e.,
  Semantic JSON.   Main advantages of using Semantic JSON are:
    + Easy integration with Facebook or any other social n/w data.
    + Can be maintained easily and allows SPARQL queries.
    + A browser plugin can be developed in Javascript to query JSON.
    
- To develop profile of each web-page, RDFa microformats functionality
  of HTML5 can be used.
