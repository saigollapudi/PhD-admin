**Progress Report of Semester January to April 2013**

This semester I finished the missing pieces of my work and completed
writing my thesis. Following is the list of work accomplished in the
semester: 

+ To test the working prototype of Alipi approach, I conducted a user
  study in R\&D showcase of our university. Results of the study are
  included in the thesis chapter.

+ Based on the reviews which we received for our paper on Power of
  Friends from OzCHI-2012, we modified our work. For the same, we
  extended our study to test the game prototype with larger number of
  communities both in size as well as in number. We submitted the
  paper to CHI-2013 where it got accepted in Work-in-progress
  category. Attached is a copy of the reviews.

+ I worked on the browser plugin to enable Alipi on every page. The
  work is also included in the thesis.
