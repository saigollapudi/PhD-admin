** Schema Design for Virtual lab
Suitable database: JSON 
3 tables: dnc_specs, develop_specs, lab_specs
+ dnc_specs(discipline, dnc, email-id, contact no), discipline is
  the primary key
+ develop_specs(discipline, name-of-lab,hosted-url, institute,
  lab-developer, email-id, contact no), where discipline is a foreign key
  relationship from the table dnc_specs
+ lab_specs(lab-name, client-prop-req, client-opensource-req,
  server-prop-req, client-opensource-req), where lab-name is a foreign
  key relationship from the table develop_specs.

* Involved in Virtual Lab Dashboard development with Mahesh.
+ How to design the dashboard? (design and usability aspects)
+ How to integrate the dashboard with the database? One issue with
  this integration is that Drupal has its own MySQL database format.

* Search Engine Facility on Virtual lab page
+ How to crawl the content of various labs? Issue: Labs do not follow
  a similar structure to keep the lab content.
    - Possible ways: Manually crawl the content and keep it in a
      database; or, use Nutch to crawl data from website directly.    
+ possible solutions: home-made code or an already developed search
  engine (using Lucene, Nutch, Luke, Solr)

* Populating Pascal Wiki page

* Maintianing the Google Discussion Forum of all the research meetings.

* 7th to 12th July
+ SVN tutorial
+ Checklist for the sprint
