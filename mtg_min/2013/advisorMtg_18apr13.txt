+ SG also presented his second idea of "resurrecting Swami" - a semantic web project
+ Dinesh discussed the concept of Rennaration - he said newspapers are rennarration, books are rennarration ... almost everything around us a rennarration of sorts
+ Dinesh explained about his IDH project (Lepakshi) - India Digital Hertiage project
+ Dinesh talked about Sweets, Sweets Dbase and some reference to ontologies
+ Sweets are semantic tweets
+ Dinesh talked about how Sweets form relationships between entitities, and how it is distributed in control 

5:00 - 5:15 discussion with Dinesh
+ SG presented his understanding of the IDH, Alipi, Renarration discussion
+ SG talked about how 3 clusters are visible: (1) a markup technology, (2) a navigation technology, and a (3) namespace technology
+ SG talked about alipi, IDH as mark-up technology where they take text or imgs and annotated it with Sweets.
+ SG talked about sweets & their dbase being in the center of this tri-fragmented view
+ SG presented the namespace on top as a epistimological space where the knowledge is categorized and structured - ontologies... SG also added metaphors, models... Dinesh added Mindmaps
+ SG discussed the last space as navigation technology - alipi, IDH have these sweet navigation capability. SG also saw an opportunity to do walkthrus and searches in this ontology space. Moreover, more than delivering content, an experience can be created.
+ Navigation experience can be when Bhagawad Gita is presented in text with some Krishna bhajans playing as audio in the bkg and man struggling images showing in as backdrop / watermark -- all selected by the intelligent agent ... just from the sematic relatinships that sweets divulged. 

5:45 - 6:45 discussion with VC
+ SG presented the defragmented concept of Sweets+IDH+Alipi structures. It was SG's understanding of this... as explained to Dinesh
+ VC refocused the discussion on Renarration, Personalization
+ VC talked about abstraction of Renarration - existing content being reltold - so this becomes a content creator, Assessibility story
+ VC talked about Personalization being a semantic style sheet; SG added "lenses", "perspectives", "personas"... VC point is that semantic style sheets helps in sensemaking and categorizing content
+ VC talked about tools for curator, renarrator - ontological tools that can help renarrator identify audiences, perspectives
+ VC also enquired about status of T4E paper
+ SG talked about possibly including a browser-add-on paper for T4E.
